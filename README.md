# ImageCombiner
simple Image Combiner... give it two images and it outputs them together as a single side-by-side without edits (I couldn't find any good examples of this for phone/computer in a braindead-easy-to-use manner, and AI keeps making modifications). Because this is is just a static HTML page (for now) you can install it to portable devices as a PWA if you want.

Currently this is just a static implementation and does all processing on your device (no internet needed, no submissions to servers).. future expansion might add it to a discord-bot for integration there via chat slash-commands.
